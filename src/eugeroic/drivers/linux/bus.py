# This code is particularly convoluted because we want to use the dbus_next package
# which is async, but we don't want to force the callers of this function to be async
# as well. So we start a separate thread with its own event loop, run the async stuff,
# and then shut it down.
#
# We also can't call Inhibit with one bus connection, retain the cookie, and call UnInhibit [sic]
# with another bus connection, because the cookie is only valid for the connection it was
# created on. So we need to maintain the bus connection for the duration of the context manager.
#
# Additional complexity is added by the fact that we want to be able to raise exceptions
# from the async code in the main thread, so we need to use threading.Event to signal
# when the async code has finished, and then raise the exception in the main thread.
#
# Finally, we want to be able to use this code as a context manager, so we need to
# be able to signal as the async code progresses and when the async code has finished, and then
# wait in the main thread for those signals.
#
# Finally, a D-Bus may not be available, so we need to be able to fall back to a fake implementation
# if the real one isn't available to allow the implementation to proceed gracefully (and be tested
# in environments without a D-Bus). Even if the D-Bus is available, the required endpoints may not
# be available, so we need to be able to fall back to a fake implementation in that case as well.
